# Tic-Tac-Toe
Creating a game called Tic-Tack-Toe using cpp

Tic-Tac-Toe is probably a game you are familiar with. It's a pretty easy game, right? The lion's share of people believe that. Tic-Tac-Toe, however, isn't as simple as you might think if you give it some serious thought.

Many games, including tic-tac-toe, require players to anticipate their opponents' moves and try to predict what they might do next. So, let this brainy game begin!

## Rules:
* The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
* Player-1 is [X], Player-2 is [O]. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. 
* The first player to get 3 of his/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. 
* When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.

### Good luck and have fun!
